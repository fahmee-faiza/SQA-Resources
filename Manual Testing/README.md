### What is Manual Testing?
Manual testing is a type of software testing that involves executing test cases manually, without using any automation tools. 
It is a process of identifying defects, errors, or issues in the software by using a set of predefined test cases and performing various actions on the software to ensure that it meets the desired functional and non-functional requirements.
In manual testing, the tester manually executes test cases to verify the functionality, usability, performance, and other aspects of the software. 
It involves performing various actions such as clicking buttons, entering data, and verifying results, and comparing them with expected outcomes. 
The tester also records the results and any defects found during the testing process.


### Benefits of Manual Testing
Manual testing is useful in scenarios where automated testing is not feasible or when the software is still in the development phase and not ready for automation. 
It is also useful for testing user interfaces and other scenarios that cannot be easily automated.
Manual testing is often less expensive than automated testing, as it does not require the use of automation tools and technologies.


### How Manual Testing is generally performed?
Manual testing is typically performed in several steps, which include:

* Test planning: The first step in manual testing is to define the testing objectives, scope, and requirements. The test plan includes a list of test cases, test scenarios, and the expected results.

* Test case creation: The next step is to create the test cases, which includes a set of steps to perform on the software and the expected outcome.

* Test case execution: The tester performs the test cases manually, following the steps in the test case and recording the results and any defects or issues found during the testing process.

* Defect reporting: Any defects or issues identified during the testing process are recorded and reported to the development team for further analysis and resolution.

* Retesting: Once the defects have been resolved, the tester performs retesting to ensure that the issue has been fixed and the software meets the desired requirements.

* Regression testing: Regression testing is performed to ensure that the changes made to the software do not cause any unintended consequences or break existing functionality.

* Test closure: The final step in manual testing is to document the test results and any issues found during the testing process. 
                This information is used to improve the testing process in the future.

Manual testing can be performed using various techniques, including exploratory testing, ad-hoc testing, and usability testing. 
The tester follows a set of predefined test cases, and any defects or issues found during the testing process are recorded and reported to the development team. 
Manual testing is often performed in conjunction with automated testing to ensure that the software meets the desired quality standards.
